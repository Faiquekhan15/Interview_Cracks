2. Data Partitioning 
In data partitioning, a large dataset is divided into smaller pieces. Which of the following are true? 
Pick ONE OR MORE options

c)  Vertical and horizontal partitioning cannot be combined. 
d) Round-robin partitioning is a partitioning strategy that is especially good when the number of partitions changes over time.
