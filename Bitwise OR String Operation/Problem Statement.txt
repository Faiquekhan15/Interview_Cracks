Have the function BiwiseOne (strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArrr, which will only contain two  strings of equal length that represent binary numbers,and return a final binary string that performed the bitwise OR operation  on both strings .A bitwise OR opertaion places a 0 in the new string where there are zeros in both binary strings ,otherwise it places 1 in that spot For example if strArr is ["1001","0100"] then your program should return the string "1101"
